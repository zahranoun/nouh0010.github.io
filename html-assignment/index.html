            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3>I'm from Iran, and I'm 18 years old. I was born in Canada on Feburary the 17<sup>th</sup>, 2005. I speak three languages all the time, <em>English</em> being my main one, <em>Farsi</em>, and <em>Arabic</em>. Through the media design program, I plan to learn brand and web designing which I'm excited about!</h3>
            <h3>One of my favourite things to do as a hobby is cooking and learning new recipes. My most favourite foods to cook are my cultural Persian foods and desserts, such as rice with red berries and chicken, Persian pudding, and lots more. I also really love watching <abbr title="Action Movies, TV Shows, K-Drama Series">netflix</abbr> and chill.</h3>
